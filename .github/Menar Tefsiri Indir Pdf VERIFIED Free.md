## What is the Menar Tefsiri?
 
The Menar Tefsiri is a Quran commentary that was written by Mehmet Akif Ersoy (1873-1936), a Turkish poet, writer, and politician. He is best known for writing the lyrics of the Turkish national anthem. Ersoy was also a devout Muslim who studied the Quran and its interpretation extensively. He wrote the Menar Tefsiri between 1924 and 1936, but it was only published posthumously in 1955.
 
The Menar Tefsiri is considered one of the most comprehensive and original Quran commentaries in Turkish. It covers the entire Quran in 12 volumes, with each volume containing an introduction, a summary of the main themes, a verse-by-verse explanation, and a conclusion. Ersoy used various sources of Quranic exegesis, such as classical tafsirs, hadiths, linguistic analysis, historical context, and rational arguments. He also incorporated his own insights and opinions on various issues, such as theology, ethics, politics, science, and culture.
