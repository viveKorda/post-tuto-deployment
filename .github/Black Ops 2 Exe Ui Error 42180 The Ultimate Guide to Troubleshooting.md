## How to Improve Your Aim and Reflexes in Black Ops 2
 
Aiming and reflexes are crucial skills for any shooter game, especially for Black Ops 2. If you want to get better at aiming and reflexes, you need to practice and follow some tips and tricks. Here are some of them:

- Adjust your sensitivity. Sensitivity is how fast your crosshair moves when you move your mouse or controller. You need to find a sensitivity that suits your playstyle and preference. A higher sensitivity can help you react faster and turn around quicker, but it can also make your aim less accurate and stable. A lower sensitivity can help you aim more precisely and steadily, but it can also make you slower and more vulnerable. Experiment with different sensitivity settings until you find the one that works best for you.
- Use the right weapons and attachments. Different weapons and attachments have different advantages and disadvantages for aiming. For example, some weapons have higher damage, range, accuracy, or fire rate than others, but they may also have more recoil, sway, or reload time. Some attachments can improve your aim by reducing recoil, increasing accuracy, or adding a scope, but they may also have drawbacks such as reducing mobility, fire rate, or ammo capacity. Choose the weapons and attachments that suit your playstyle and the map you are playing on.
- Aim for the head. Headshots are the most effective way to kill enemies in Black Ops 2. They deal more damage and can often result in a one-shot kill. To aim for the head, you need to train your muscle memory and eye coordination. Practice aiming at the head level of enemies in different situations and distances. Use bots or custom games to practice your headshots without pressure.
- Pre-aim and centering. Pre-aiming is aiming at where you expect enemies to be before you see them. Centering is keeping your crosshair at the center of your screen at all times. These techniques can help you reduce the time and distance you need to move your crosshair to aim at enemies. To pre-aim and center, you need to learn the maps and the common spots where enemies usually appear or hide. You also need to pay attention to the radar, sound cues, and teammate callouts to anticipate enemy movements.

## How to Survive Longer in Zombies Mode in Black Ops 2
 
Zombies mode is a fun and challenging mode in Black Ops 2 where you have to fight endless waves of zombies with limited resources and perks. If you want to survive longer in zombies mode, you need to follow some tips and tricks. Here are some of them:

- Repair barriers. Barriers are wooden planks that block zombies from entering certain areas. You can repair barriers by holding the action button near them. Repairing barriers can give you extra points and slow down zombies from reaching you. However, don't repair barriers too often or too close to zombies, as they can still hit you through them.
- Avoid the starting weapons. The starting weapons on the wall are not very effective against zombies after the first few rounds. They have low damage, accuracy, and ammo capacity. You should try to use the mystery box as soon as possible to get better weapons. The mystery box is a random weapon generator that costs 950 points per use. You can find it by looking for a blue light in the sky.
- Use buildables. Buildables are items that you can craft by finding parts and using workbenches around the map. Buildables can help you survive by providing defense, offense, or utility. For example, the zombie shield can protect you from behind, the turbine can power up certain machines, and the jet gun can kill zombies with a blast of air.
- Aim for their heads. As mentioned before, headshots are the most efficient way to kill zombies. They deal more damage and save ammo. However, don't knife zombies unless it's the first round or you have a melee weapon like the galvaknuckles or the thunderfists.
- Play with other people. Zombies mode is much easier and more fun when you play with other people online or offline. You can cooperate with your teammates by reviving them when they go down, sharing points and weapons, covering each other's backs, and communicating strategies.
- Find bottlenecks. Bottlenecks are narrow areas where
