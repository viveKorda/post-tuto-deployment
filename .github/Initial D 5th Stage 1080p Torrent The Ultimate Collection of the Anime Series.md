## What is TeknoMW3 and why use it?
 
TeknoMW3 is a mod for Modern Warfare 3 that allows you to play online with other players who have the same version of the game[^1^]. It also adds some features and options to customize your gameplay, such as changing your FOV, enabling console commands, hosting dedicated servers, and more[^1^]. TeknoMW3 is not affiliated with Activision or Infinity Ward, and it does not support piracy or cheating. You will need a legitimate copy of Modern Warfare 3 to use TeknoMW3.
 
One of the main reasons to use TeknoMW3 is to avoid the problems and risks that come with playing on the official servers. As mentioned before, the Steam version of Modern Warfare 3 has a remote exploit that was never patched and can cause some chaos on your PC[^2^]. The official servers are also plagued by hackers, modders, and boosters who ruin the game for everyone else. TeknoMW3 has a better anti-cheat system and a more active community that can ban or kick abusive players[^1^]. TeknoMW3 also allows you to play with DLCs without having to buy them, as long as you have them installed on your PC[^1^].
 
## What are some tips for playing Modern Warfare 3 online?
 
Modern Warfare 3 is a fast-paced, gun-on-gun shooter that requires quick reflexes, good aim, and smart tactics. Here are some tips that can help you improve your game and have more fun online:

- Choose the right class for your playstyle. Modern Warfare 3 has a variety of weapons, perks, attachments, and killstreaks that you can customize to suit your preferences. Experiment with different combinations and see what works best for you. For example, if you like to rush and flank your enemies, you may want to use an SMG with a silencer, Sleight of Hand, Assassin, and Dead Silence. If you prefer to stay back and snipe, you may want to use a sniper rifle with a variable zoom scope, Blind Eye, Quickdraw, and Marksman.
- Learn the maps and the spawns. Knowing the layout of the maps and the locations of the spawn points can give you an edge over your opponents. You can use this knowledge to predict where they will come from, where they will hide, and where they will go. You can also use this knowledge to avoid getting spawn trapped or spawn killed by the enemy team. Try to memorize the hotspots, chokepoints, sightlines, and cover spots on each map.
- Use cover and movement wisely. Modern Warfare 3 is not a game where you can stand still and expect to survive. You need to constantly move around and use cover to avoid getting shot. However, you also need to be careful not to expose yourself too much or run into enemy fire. Use cover to break line of sight, peek around corners, reload, heal, or wait for your teammates. Use movement to flank your enemies, escape danger, or rush objectives. Don't be afraid to crouch or prone if necessary.
- Communicate and cooperate with your team. Modern Warfare 3 is a team-based game that requires coordination and teamwork to win. You can use voice chat or text chat to communicate with your teammates and share information. You can also use the in-game callouts or ping system to mark enemies or objectives. Try to work together with your team and support each other. For example, you can cover each other's backs, revive each other's downed teammates, or combine your killstreaks for maximum effect.
- Have fun and don't rage quit. Modern Warfare 3 is a game that can be very enjoyable and rewarding if you play it right. However, it can also be very frustrating and infuriating if you play it wrong. You may encounter hackers, campers, noobs, trolls, or other annoying players who will make you want to quit. You may also have bad games where you die a lot or lose badly. Don't let these things get to you and ruin your mood. Remember that it's just a game and that everyone has good days and bad days. Try to learn from your mistakes and improve your skills. Don't rage quit or be toxic to others. Instead, be respectful and sportsmanlike.
