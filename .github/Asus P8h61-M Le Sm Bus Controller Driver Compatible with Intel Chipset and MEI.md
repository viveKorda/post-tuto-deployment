## Benefits of Asus P8h61-M Le Motherboard
 
Although the Asus P8h61-M Le motherboard is a budget model, it still has some benefits that make it a good choice for some users. Here are some of the advantages of this motherboard:

- It supports the Intel second generation Core i7 / Core i5 / Core i3 processors in LGA1155 package, which are among the most powerful and energy efficient CPUs in the world[^1^].
- It has a UEFI BIOS, which is a mouse-driven graphical interface that makes it easy to set up and configure the system[^1^].
- It has an Anti-Surge Protection Design, which detects overvoltage conditions and prevents voltage surges from damaging the motherboard and the system[^1^].
- It has an EPU switch, which allows you to tap into the worldâs first real time PC power saving engine and reduce the power consumption and fan noise of your system[^1^].
- It has a micro ATX form factor, which means it can fit into smaller cases and save space[^2^].
- It has a low price, which makes it affordable for users who are on a tight budget or do not need many features[^3^].

However, the Asus P8h61-M Le motherboard also has some drawbacks that you should be aware of before buying it. Here are some of the disadvantages of this motherboard:

- It only has four SATA3 ports and no SATA2 ports, which limits your storage options[^1^].
- It only has USB2 ports and not USB3 ports, which means slower data transfer speeds for your external devices[^1^].
- It only has two memory slots, which makes it harder to upgrade your memory later[^1^].
- It only has DVI and VGA outputs for the integrated graphics, but no HDMI output, which means you cannot connect it to a high-definition monitor or TV without an adapter[^1^].
- It only has three minijack plugs for the sound card, which means you need to use your caseâs front panel audio jack to run a 7.1 sound system[^1^].
- It has a minimal specification, which means it may not support some advanced features or future upgrades[^3^].

In conclusion, the Asus P8h61-M Le motherboard is a competent budget Sandy Bridge motherboard that has some useful tweaking features, but its specification is minimal. It is suitable for users who are looking for a low-cost and simple solution for their system, but not for users who are looking for high performance or expandability.
