## Downloading Oracle Developer 6i for Windows 7 64 Bit
 
To download Oracle Developer 6i for Windows 7 64 bit, you need to have a commercial license from Oracle. If you already have one, you can access the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud[^2^], which is the official site to download your Oracle software. You will need to sign in with your Oracle account and accept the terms and conditions.
 
Once you are in the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud, you can search for "Oracle Developer" in the search box. You will see a list of products that match your query. You need to select "Oracle Developer Suite" and then choose the version "9.0.4". This is the latest version of Oracle Developer 6i that was released in 2004.
 
After selecting the product and version, you will see a list of platforms that are supported by Oracle Developer 6i. You need to select "Microsoft Windows (32-bit)" as your platform. This is because Oracle Developer 6i does not have a native 64-bit version, but it can run on a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows OS with some adjustments.
 
After selecting your platform, you will see a list of files that are available for download. You need to download two files: "Oracle9iDS Release2 (9.0.4) Part Number B10471-01" and "Oracle9iDS Release2 (9.0.4) Part Number B10472-01". These are zip files that contain the installation files for Oracle Developer 6i.
 
You can download these files by clicking on their names and choosing a location on your computer to save them. The download may take some time depending on your internet speed and connection.
  
## Installing Oracle Developer 6i on Windows 7 64 Bit
 
After downloading the zip files, you need to extract them to a fresh directory on your computer. You can use any unzip tool that you prefer, such as WinZip or WinRAR.

Before installing Oracle Developer 6i, you need to make sure that you have a JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your computer. You can check this by opening a command prompt and typing "java -version". If you see a message like "java version \"11.0.11\"", then you have a JDK installed. If not, you need to download and install one from the Oracle website[^1^]. We recommend using JDK 11 as it is officially supported by SQL Developer[^1^], which is one of the alternatives to Oracle Developer 6i that we will discuss later.
 
After ensuring that you have a JDK installed, you can proceed with installing Oracle Developer 6i by following these steps:
 
1. Run "setup.exe" as administrator (right click -> "Run as Administrator") from the directory where you extracted the zip files.
2. Select "Forms Developer" option -> Typical Install -> Choose "NO" for Server installation when installation finishes.
3. Repeat step 1 and select "Reports Developer" option -> Typical Install -> Choose "NO" for Server installation when installation finishes.
4. Restart your computer.
