Some of the notable achievements of Firoz Shah Tughlaq during his reign were:
 
- He established a department of public works (Diwan-i-Khairat) to build and maintain roads, bridges, canals, wells, mosques, schools, hospitals, and other public facilities.
- He reformed the tax system and abolished many oppressive and unjust taxes, such as the jizya (poll tax on non-Muslims), the zakat (alms tax), and the kharaj (land tax).
- He patronized learning and culture and founded several madrasas (Islamic schools) and libraries. He also collected and preserved many ancient manuscripts and relics from India and other countries.
- He promoted religious tolerance and harmony and allowed Hindus to practice their faith freely. He also repaired and restored many Hindu temples that had been damaged or destroyed by his predecessors.
- He expanded his empire by conquering Bengal, Orissa, Gujarat, Sindh, Multan, Kashmir, and parts of Nepal. He also maintained friendly relations with foreign rulers, such as the Mongols, the Turks, the Chinese, and the Persians.

Firoz Shah Tughlaq was a benevolent and enlightened ruler who is remembered as one of the greatest sultans of Delhi. He died in 1388 at the age of 90 and was buried in a magnificent tomb in Delhi.

After the death of Firoz Shah Tughlaq, the Delhi Sultanate entered a period of decline and chaos. His successors were weak and incompetent and faced rebellions and invasions from various enemies. The most serious threat came from Timur, the Mongol conqueror who invaded India in 1398 and sacked Delhi, killing thousands of people and looting its wealth. Timur's invasion marked the end of the Tughlaq dynasty and the beginning of the Sayyid dynasty, which ruled Delhi until 1451.
 
The legacy of Firoz Shah Tughlaq is still evident in many parts of India, where his monuments and inscriptions can be seen. He is also praised by many historians and writers for his achievements and reforms. Some of his admirers include Ziauddin Barani, Amir Khusrau, Ibn Battuta, Abul Fazl, and Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. He is regarded as one of the most remarkable rulers of medieval India and a model of good governance and justice.
