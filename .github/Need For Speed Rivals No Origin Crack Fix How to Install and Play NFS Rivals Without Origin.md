# How to Play Need for Speed: Rivals Without Origin
 
If you are a fan of racing games, you might have heard of Need for Speed: Rivals, a thrilling game that lets you play as either a cop or a racer in an open-world environment. However, if you want to play this game on your PC, you will need to install Origin, the online gaming platform by EA. Origin can be annoying for some players, as it requires an internet connection, takes up disk space, and sometimes causes performance issues. Fortunately, there is a way to play Need for Speed: Rivals without Origin, by using a crack fix.

A crack fix is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses the Origin check and lets you play the game offline. There are several crack fixes available for Need for Speed: Rivals, but not all of them work properly. Some of them may cause crashes, glitches, or compatibility problems. In this article, we will show you how to download and install the best crack fix for Need for Speed: Rivals that works with all versions of the game.
 
## Step 1: Download the Crack Fix
 
The first step is to download the crack fix from a reliable source. We recommend using the one by 3DM or Reloaded, as they are the most popular and trusted groups that release crack fixes for games. You can find their crack fixes on MegaGames[^1^] [^2^] [^3^], a website that hosts game fixes, trainers, mods, and cheats. To download the crack fix, follow these steps:
 
- Go to MegaGames.com and search for "Need for Speed: Rivals" in the search box.
- Click on the link that matches your version of the game. For example, if you have version 1.4.0.0 of the game, click on "Need for Speed: Rivals v1.4.0.0 All No-DVD [Reloaded]".
- On the next page, click on the "Download" button and wait for the file to download. The file name should be something like "NEED.FOR.SPEED.R.V1.4.0.0.ALL.RELOADED.NODVD.ZIP".
- Save the file to a location where you can easily find it later.

## Step 2: Install the Crack Fix
 
The next step is to install the crack fix on your PC. To do this, follow these steps:

- Locate the downloaded file and extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
- Open the extracted folder and find the file named "NFS14.exe". This is the cracked executable file that will replace the original one.
- Copy this file and paste it into your game installation folder. This is usually located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Need for Speed(TM) Rivals".
- When prompted, choose to overwrite or replace the existing file.
- Run the game as administrator by right-clicking on "NFS14.exe" and selecting "Run as administrator".

## Step 3: Enjoy the Game
 
Congratulations! You have successfully installed the crack fix for Need for Speed: Rivals and can now play the game without Origin. You can enjoy all the features of the game offline, such as customizing your car, upgrading your weapons, and competing with other players in dynamic events. However, keep in mind that some online features may not work with the crack fix, such as multiplayer mode or cloud saving. Also, make sure to disable your antivirus software before running the game, as some antivirus programs may detect the crack fix as a virus and delete it.
